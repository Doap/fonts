This project contains the sources for the various open source fonts.

Please see http://fonts.doap.com/ for access via web.

Each subdirectory contains fonts from a single designer. The .ttf font
files are at the top level of each directory. Various source files are often present in a src/ directory
under that in a variety of formats.  Use at your own risk. Each directory
also contains a METADATA file (in simple Java properties file format, but UTF-8
encoding) with metadata for the font files.

Most fonts use the SIL Open Font License, version 1.1. A few fonts use the
Apache 2 license. Each directory contains the appropriate license file for the
fonts in that directory and the fonts files themselves also contain the
licensing and authorship metadata.

When branching to modify or extend the fonts, please be mindful of the need to
use your own name and not conflict with existing namespace, reserved names, trademarks
and consider the recommended best practices to publish and merge changes
upstream.

Enjoy the fonts!
